# Groupe-54---2D-human-pose

## Introduction
For our Deep Learning for Autonomous Vehicles class, we had to solve a task which was part of an autonomous driving vehicle. We chose the task about the 2D human pose detection for which we had to predict the pose of a human body in a given 2D image. This includes the positions and orientations of various body parts, such as the head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles.
In order to do that, we will start from a state-of-the-art deep learning model, OpenPifPaf, desgined to detect and estimate the poses of multiple people in 2D images. We will use the MS COCO dataset, usually used for various computer vision tasks.
